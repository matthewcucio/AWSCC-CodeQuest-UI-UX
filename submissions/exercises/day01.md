#### <h2 align=center> 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1 </h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: 
    
    Based on my experience, going through Shopee‚Äôs website proves to be more efficient in finding my desired products. The platform's interface appears to be more user-friendly, providing a smoother product search experience compared to Lazada.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: 
    
    Shopee, unfortunately, introduces distractions that might hinder user experience, such as pop-up ads in the center upon opening the app and lower-right ads. These elements can be perceived as intrusive and contribute to potential confusion for users.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platforms‚Äô content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: 
    
    Lazada has a lot of plain elements such as in the category section. In contrast, Shopee employs a more visually comfortable approach by adding a subtle touch like the appearance of light grey circles as shadows around images. This element not only enhances the visual appeal but also contributes to a more engaging and aesthetically pleasing user experience on Shopee's platform. The use of shadows in the category section on Shopee adds depth to the images, making them stand out in a more visually appealing manner compared to Lazada's simpler presentation.

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websites‚Äô layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: 
    
    Lazada's website showcases a visually pleasing and consistent design, especially for those inclined towards a minimalist aesthetic. Shopee, on the other hand, employs a more dynamic layout with background colors in various sections, contributing to a visually pleasing experience. Notably, Shopee avoids using pure black text, enhancing the overall design consistency.
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer:
    
    Both Lazada and Shopee exhibit excellent responsiveness across different devices, ensuring a seamless user experience regardless of the platform used.

-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer:
    
    In terms of the visual aspect of the website, Shopee stands out for me with its well-coordinated color scheme and uncluttered elements. Lazada, while maintaining a minimalist approach with a white background, might appear plain visually but gains points for its simplicity and adherence to a minimalist aesthetic, catering to those with a preference for such design principles.

It was fun playing the ‚ÄúIt's Centered That‚Äù game and luckily, I answered the 10 items correctly on my first try. As the challenge progressed, particularly with items 7-10 becoming more difficult, I spent more than 5 minutes on each item to look and focus intensely if the dot was really centered. 

Despite the heightened challenge in the latter part of the game, the overall experience was engaging and entertaining. The game effectively combined fun and concentration, offering a unique blend of enjoyment and mental stimulation. I appreciated the balance between difficulty levels, making the entire gameplay both a satisfying accomplishment and an entertaining challenge.
