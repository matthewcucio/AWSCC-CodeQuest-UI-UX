#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: Based on my experience, going through Shopeeâ€™s website proves to be more efficient in finding my desired products. The platform's interface appears to be more user-friendly, providing a smoother product search experience compared to Lazada.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: Shopee, unfortunately, introduces distractions that might hinder user experience, such as pop-up ads in the center upon opening the app and lower-right ads. These elements can be perceived as intrusive and contribute to potential confusion for users.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: Lazada has a lot of plain elements such as in the category section. In contrast, Shopee employs a more visually comfortable approach by adding a subtle touch like the appearance of light grey circles as shadows around images. This element not only enhances the visual appeal but also contributes to a more engaging and aesthetically pleasing user experience on Shopee's platform. The use of shadows in the category section on Shopee adds depth to the images, making them stand out in a more visually appealing manner compared to Lazada's simpler presentation.
