#### <h2 align=center>  Hello there, my fellow Alfbuddy! ðŸ’–  </h2>

**Day 3: Design Principles**<br/>

The C.R.A.P. Design Principles shared have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of design and its intricacies. Initially, delving into the world of UI design felt daunting, with numerous elements to consider and balance. However, the CRAP acronym â€“ Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity â€“ provided a structured framework that simplified the complexities of design and illuminated its fundamental principles.

Below is my Figma Link **"Week 1 [Day 3] : Activity"** wherein I was able to reflect on my journey with the C.R.A.P. Design Principles, I've gained a deeper appreciation for the art and science of UI design. Beyond mere aesthetics, these principles serve as guiding lights, empowering me to craft designs that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and user-centric.

Playing the Can't Unsee game was super cool! It was like a puzzle game, but instead of matching shapes or colors, I had to spot tiny differences in designs. It was surprisingly addictive!

Each round of the game gave me a new challenge. I had to pay close attention to things like how words were arranged, if colors matched up, or if things were lined up straight. It was tricky, but really fun once I got the hang of it.

What's even cooler is that the game wasn't just for fun. It actually helped me get better at noticing details and understanding why certain designs work better than others. Plus, it was awesome to compare scores and chat about the designs with my friends.

Looking back, playing the Can't Unsee game wasn't just a way to pass the time. It was a fun way to learn more about design and challenge myself to become better at spotting little details. Now, I feel more confident in my design skills and can't wait to use what I've learned in future projects!
