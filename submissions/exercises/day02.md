**<h1 align="center"> DAY 2: Figma Basics </h1>**
**_I had ever wished for a magical canvas where creativity knows no bounds, and collaboration seamlessly intertwines with design!_**

In this challenge, I entered Figma, the virtual wonderland for designers and creative teams alike. Imagine a platform that not only brings your design visions to life but also transforms collaboration into an art form!

At its core, **Figma** is a cloud-based design tool that transcends the boundaries of traditional design software. No need for hefty installations or complicated setupsâ€”Figma lives in the cloud, accessible anytime, anywhere. It's not just a tool; it's a gateway to a new era of collaborative design.

During today's Day 2 activity, I got to know what Figma is, exploring its basic functionalities through introductory tutorials. As a beginner in design tools, I found Figma's user-friendly interface and intuitive features to be particularly welcoming. Also, throughout the session, I absorbed essential concepts such as frames, shapes, color manipulation, text formatting, image handling, exporting options, component management, commenting capabilities, and sharing functionalities. I know that these newly acquired skills not only equip me for the remainder of the Code Quest but also serve as a foundation for my future design endeavors. I'm eager to continue expanding my knowledge and expertise in Figma, knowing that it will be a valuable asset in my creative pursuits beyond this event.
