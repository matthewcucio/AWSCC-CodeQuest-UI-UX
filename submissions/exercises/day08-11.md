**<h1 align=center> WEEK 2 Day 8 - 11 [UX Research Activities]**<br/></h1>


For the days 8 to 11, the focus was on developing a comprehensive understanding of user needs, defining problems, analyzing competitors, and generating innovative solutions. It began with a deep understanding into empathy in design, highlighting the importance of UX Research in understanding users and their needs. I learned about the Design Sprint process, specifically focusing on the Empathize phase, where I created User Personas and Empathy Maps for AlfBuddy, an emerging e-commerce pet shop. This exercise aimed to build a strong connection with users, ensuring that the redesigned website would address specific needs and preferences.

Moving on to the Define phase, I learned how to formulate a strong problem statement and identify pain points in the user experience. Also established success metrics and user needs to guide the redesign process effectively.

It then shifted focus to Competitor Analysis, emphasizing the importance of understanding competitors in the UX design process. I learned how to conduct a thorough competitor analysis to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of rival pet shops. This analysis helped me identify unique features that could position AlfBuddy as a standout destination for pet enthusiasts. 

Lastly, for the last day, it concluded with the Ideate phase, where I were tasked with generating features and functionalities that directly addressed the pain points identified in the Define phase. I also focused on highlighting unique features that AlfBuddy could leverage to distinguish itself in the competitive landscape. Overall, this provided me with a holistic approach to UX design, equipping me with the tools and techniques needed to create user-centric and innovative solutions for AlfBuddy's redesign.
